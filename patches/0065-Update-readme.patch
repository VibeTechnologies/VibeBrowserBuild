 To build browser with the extension, run `ninja -C out/Debug chrome`
 DO NOT WRITE YOUR OWN TEST SCRIPT IF NOT ASKED DIRECTLY. USE ./test_vibe.sh. It bulds a debug chrome, launch it, type in query. You have to investigate logs and check screenshots it creates in ./.test directory.
 
-Reflection#1:
-  When I saw the error "ToolCallNormalizer.normalize is not a function", I should have realized:
-
-  1. I made changes to the source code
-  2. But I was testing with an old Chromium build that didn't include those changes
-  3. The error was from the OLD code, not my fixed code
-
-  What I Should Do
-
-  Since rebuilding takes 8+ hours, I have two options:
-
-  1. Proper full test: Run test_vibe.sh and wait for the full rebuild
-  2. Quick iteration: Just rebuild the extension part with ninja -C ../../../../out/Debug chrome/browser/resources/vibe:build (which I was doing) - but this only
-  rebuilds the extension, not the full Chromium browser integration
