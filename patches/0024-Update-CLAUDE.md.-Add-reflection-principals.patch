 # Instructions:
-
 - You are an experienced software engineer that is working on AI-Native Web Browser - Vibe Browser
 - Keep you answers short.
+- Todo to break down the complex refactor into manageable tasks
 - read project documetantion at doc/*.md
 - Think, create a goal and plan how to do it, before starting to work on the task.
 - do not clean build directory out/Debug, it takes 8 hours to rebuild everything

 3. **Component Loader**: Register extension path in `component_loader.cc`
 4. **Build Integration**: Include "vibe:build" in resources BUILD.gn
 
+### Component Extensions Are Different
+  - They don't appear in chrome://extensions like regular extensions
+  - They're loaded automatically by the browser, not by user action
+  - Testing their presence requires different approaches
+
+### Pirocess Improvements for Next Time:
+
+  1. Research Phase
+  - Spend more time understanding API versions and compatibility
+  - Read documentation for new tools/libraries before using them
+  - Verify build systems work before making changes
+
+  2. Incremental Testing
+  - Test each major change individually rather than batching them
+  - This would have caught the CDP API issues earlier
+  - Shorter feedback loops lead to faster problem resolution
+
+  3. Simplification First
+  - When refactoring complex code, simplify first, then optimize
+  - Don't try to preserve every nuance of the original implementation
+  - Focus on core functionality, then add sophistication
+
+  4. Documentation
+  - Should have documented the CDP methods and their purposes
+  - Would help future maintainers understand the browser automation flow
+  - Could have added more inline comments explaining the CDP approach
+
+
 This ensures the AI extension loads automatically with full Chrome integration and bypasses security restrictions that prevent automatic side panel opening.
